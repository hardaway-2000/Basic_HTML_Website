ðŸ“„ Single-Page CV and Portfolio Structure
This repository contains the foundational HTML structure for a multi-page portfolio and CV, built purely with semantic HTML5 for training purposes. The goal of this project is to create a robust and accessible HTML structure that is completely separate from its styling (CSS).

ðŸŒŸ Project Goals
Semantic HTML5: Utilizing structural tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> for better accessibility and SEO.

Form Structure: Implementing a complete and accessible contact form with appropriate <label> and id attributes.

Separation of Concerns: Creating the structure in HTML only, without any styling applied.

ðŸš€ How to View the Files
These files are simple HTML documents and do not require a web server or special tools to view locally.

Clone or Download: Get the files onto your local machine.

Open in Browser: Right-click on the main file (index.html) or any other HTML page, and choose "Open with" -> [Your Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)].

ðŸ”— Training Reference
This project was developed as part of a structured learning path focused on best practices in basic and semantic HTML.
